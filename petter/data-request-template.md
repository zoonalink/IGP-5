# Template for requesting access to actigraphy data

Subject: Request for Actigraphy Data Used in Your Research

Dear [Researcher’s Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Petter Lovehagen, and I am a master’s student in data science. I recently came across your articles on using actigraphy data to predict depression using machine learning models. Your work has been incredibly insightful, and I appreciate the valuable contributions you’ve made to the field.

I noticed that you mentioned the availability of the dataset upon request. As part of a group project, we are keen to explore machine learning techniques with actigraphy data.  So far, we been working on the widely-cited Depresjon dataset but we are eager to expand our horizons.  

Our intention is not to replicate your work but rather learn from it and if possible contribute to the field. Having access to an additional unseen dataset would be invaluable to our project.  

We assure you that we will treat the data with the utmost respect, adhering to all ethical standards and proper citations. We are genuinely grateful for your consideration and look forward to the possibility of collaborating.

Thank you for your time. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards, 
Petter Lovehagen
