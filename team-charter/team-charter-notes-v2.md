* **Privacy & Confidentiality** - Protect personal and sensitive data through encryption, access controls, and aggregation/anonymisation. Follow laws and regulations like GDPR.
* **Provenance & Documentation**- Document data sources and origins. Track data lineage and processing steps. Record methodology, caveats, definitions.
* **Common Standards & Terms** - Use agreed common data standards and terminology to enable interoperability.
* **Data Definitions** - Clearly define data elements and adhere to those definitions across uses.
* **Naming Conventions** - Follow consistent naming conventions for files, folders, variables, and databases.
* **Metadata** - Assign descriptive metadata to document and enable discovery of datasets.
* **Openness & Sharing** - Make collected data open and shareable whenever possible. Avoid proprietary restrictions.
* **Reproducibility** - Enable others to reproduce results by sharing code, data, environment configurations and methodology.
* **Version Control** - Manage changes to data sources in a version control system like Git. Maintain history.
* **Quality** - Assess and ensure high quality complete data. Flag uncertainties, incomplete data, or errors discovered.
* **Curation & Preservation** - Curate data for long-term access and preservation. Use standard durable file formats and media.
* **Citation & Credit** - Require those using our data to cite the source and credit data creators. Cite sources appropriately.
