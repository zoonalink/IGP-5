## Project Description *tbd*

## Project Team Members

* Daryne Bouadi
* Tom Grubb
* Petter Lovehagen
* Yacine Ramdani
* Deniz Turan

## Project Goal *tbd*

*Specific goal and/or outcome tbd - E.g.*

*Develop machine learning models to accurately distinguish AI-generated text from human-written text.*

### Key Objectives *tbd*

*Specific objectives to be added - relevant to goal - E.g.*

* *Research text features which distinguish AI and human-written text*
* *Compile and generate datasets of AI and human-written text*
* *Extract text features like sentence structure, word usage, etc.*
* *Engineer feature vectors as model inputs*
* *Train and evaluate classifier models with extracted features*
* *Create a web front-end and/or API that predicts text origin and confidence*
