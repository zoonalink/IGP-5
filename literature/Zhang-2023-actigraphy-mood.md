## Notes

### Summary

**Question:** Can long-term actigraphic data distinguish between different mood states in hospitalised patients with bipolar disorder?

1. Are motor activity patterns beyond 24 h meaningful in the identification of the different mood states of patients with BD?
2. What is the extent of variation in the motor activity of patients with different mood states of BD?

**Methods:** 
* Observational study of 30 hospitalised patients with wrist-worn actigraphs
* Bipolar depression (BD-D), bipolar mania (BD-M) and bipolar disorder-mixed state (BD-MS)
* Motor activity differences estimated with non-parametric analysis between and within groups

**Results:** 
* Mean 24h activity level differed between groups
* In between-group:
    * intra-individual fluctuation and minute-to-minute variability in the morning and the mean activity level and min-to-min evening variabilty significantly differed between BD-M adn BD-MS
* In within-group: 
    * BD-M group showed disrupted rhythm and reduced activity complexity at night.  Both BD-D and BD-MS showed sig differences between several parameters in AM and PM

**Conclusion**
* mean activity levels during long monitoring period and intra-day variation within groups could reflect differences in motor activity
* sustained monitoring may clarify emotional states and improve diagnoses

"Owing to its simplicity and objectivity, actigraphy has recently been used extensively in the evaluation of severe mental illnesses. As a new technology, actigraphy has been recognized for its validity in measuring the motor activity and sleep patterns of patients with BD. Changes in the motor activity measured on digital actigraphy may indicate mood states. Actigraphy captures the time-varying features of BD and is often used to evaluate sleep data and daytime activity separately."

### Data

**Participants**
* 34 participants, aged 14-55, dianosed at hospital
* demographic data included age, sex, years of education, history of self-harm
* Hamilton Depression Scale (HRSD-17) for depressive symptom scores

**Actigraphy**
* Activity counts per minute
* over 3 days, less then 10 days
* Morning = 06:00-15:00, Evening = 15:00-00:00

**Activity parameter**
* Mean activity counts per minute as `measurement of overall activity levels`
* Standard deviation (SD)/min in % of the mean as `measurement of intra-individual fluctuations of activity`
* Root mean squared successive difference (RMSSD)/min in % of the mean as `the representation of variability per minute`
* Sample entropy as `indicator of the complexity of activity or level of regularity in the time series`.  Low sample entroy value = greater self-similarity or more regular.

**Statistics**
* 0.05 significance
* `Kruskal-Wallis` test to estimate distribution of age, sex, education, total number of recordings between the groups
* `Mann-Whitney` test for pairwise comparisons of diagnostic groups
    * adjusted with `Bonferroni correction`
* `Wilcoxon signed rank` test for within-group comparison/differences

### Discussion

"Although the total average activity levels could not be used to utterly distinguish the three groups, the average activity levels between the BD-M and BD-MS groups in our study differed, but not between the BD-M and BD-D groups. The reasons may be that the sample size was small, and the closed management of the wards during the epidemic of COVID-19 led to regular hospitalization and reduced activity areas, which limited the diversity of activities; these factors may have reduced the differences between the groups."

"In the morning period, there were significant differences in the intra-individual fluctuations and variabilities per minute between the groups. Both parameters increased in the BD-D and BD-MS groups compared with those in the BD-M group."

"In the evening period, we found that the BD-M group had a higher average activity level but a smaller minute-to-minute variability than the other groups. The intra-individual fluctuations differed between the groups, but pairwise comparison did not reveal any significant findings."

"Herein, the BD-D group had significant changes in the intra-day activity. From morning to evening, the intra-individual fluctuations and minute-to-minute variability decreased, while the mean activity level increased. The BD-MS group showed the same changing trend as the BD-D group. Based on the activity images, the BD-D and BD-MS groups had reduced, and more variable activity and a delayed morning activity onset compared with the BD-M group, consistent with previous reports."

"Reduced differences in morning and evening activity levels; and reduced activity complexity (decreased sample entropy values) at night were found in the BD-M group. This group was active throughout the day, and we did not find any significant differences in the intra-day activity variation, except for the sample entropy value. The sample entropy value of the BD-M group was higher in the morning, suggesting less self-similarity and more irregular time series in the morning among patients with mania."

**Limitations**

1. "First, although our study somewhat extended the follow-up period, it failed to thoroughly observe the variation from acute onset to remission in each mood state. This may account for the inability to distinguish between the mood groups."

2. "Second, the small sample of patients with BD observed in a limited activity space may influence the results. Accordingly, the results should be interpreted with caution. A similar schedule arrangement during hospitalization may also affect the activities of patients. As we mentioned above, the relatively strict rules and routines of the enclosed wards, as well as limited activity space, could equalize physical activity patterns. Moreover, this study did not include age as a covariate to further discuss the effect on motor activity. The mean age was low in all three groups, although there is robust evidence in recent decades that the peak age range for adult-pattern BD onset is approximately 15–25 years (42). However, our proof-of-concept study with a relatively small sample size prevented us from further stratifying and left us without age-appropriate controls. To further investigate the generalizability and accuracy of the motor activity findings, future studies should expand the sample size and conduct a controlled study."

3. "Third, actigraphy monitoring in our study was performed only in spring and summer. Therefore, results may be affected by seasons. In a review of previous studies, Rosenthal et al. (43) proposed that seasonal variations in photoperiod were associated with the onset and severity of BD symptoms and hospitalizations. And human circadian rhythms varied according to the seasonal changes in photoperiod, with increased motor activity in the spring and decreased activity in the autumn. Similarly, Goodwin and Jamison (44) found that manic/hypomanic symptoms peaked in the spring and early summer and that suicide attempts and completions were high in the spring and early summer (45) while depressive symptoms peaked in the fall and winter. Besides expanding the sample size, future studies should repeat the measurements across multiple seasons."

4. "Finally, different drug treatments and other potential confounding factors, such as the severity of current episodes, body mass index, and comorbidities, may affect motor activity (46). These factors may influence the accuracy of the differences observed in the activity between the groups."
