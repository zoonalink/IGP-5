## Notes

### Summary

This is the original study on the Depresjon dataset prepared by Garcia et al. 

**Findings**
* Average motor activity recorded and three non-parametric varaibles (interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV) and relative amplitude (RA)) were calculated.
* Motor activity significantly lower both in patiends with schizophrenia and depression compared to controls
* Schizophrenic patients differed from both depressed and controls, with less complex and more structured behaviour

### Data

#### Subjects

* study group = 23 patients with schizophrenia, 23 with depression, 23 control
  * control subjects were hospital employees, students, etc.
  * schizophrenia group were on antipsychotics (8 on clozapine)
  * schizoprenic patients had severe chronic mental illness and cannot live indendently
  * 15 of 23 depressed patients were on antidepressants
* MADRS for depression rating 
* BPRS for schizophrenia symptoms
* Actigraphy - actigraph recroding total activity counts for one minute intervals over two weeks. 

#### Analyses

* Interdaily stability (IS) quantifies invariability between th days - i.e. "the strength of coupling of the rhythm to supposedly stable environmental factors"
* Intradaily variability (IV) indicates fragmentation of the rhythm - i.e. "the frequency and extent of transitions between rest and activity"
* Relative amplitude (RA) is calculate using data from most active 10 hour period and least active 5 hour period in the average 24 hour pattern.
* Statisitics - T-tests (two-tailed) to calculate differences between gropus, significance level of 0.05

### Results

* ANOVA showed significant differenes between groups for all parameters, except RA
* Schizophrenic and depress patients showed substantial reductions in total activity (47% and 35% compared to control)
* Schizophrenic patients had more pronounced reduction in night time activity (57%), compared to 35% for depressed patients
* IS was 18% higher in schizophrenic patients compared to controls, but no difference for depressed (4%)
* IV was 18% lower in schizophrenic patients and 8% lower in depressed patients, compared to controls
* No differences between bipolar and unipolar depression
* Results were similar for males and females in control group - so combined 
* No significant correlation with age (different in different groups)
* No significant correlation between MADRS or BPrS and different actigraphy motor parameters
* Clozapine gropu (within schizophrenia) had more pronounced reduction in night-time activity.

"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study based on actigraphy to address differences in motor activity pattern between patients with schizophrenia and patients with depression."

"These patients are from the same setting as the patients treated with other antipsychotics, expecting the same external Zeit-gebers. Zeit-gebers means environmental agents or events that provide the cue for setting or resetting a biological clock, daylight or social factors are examples of common Zeit-gebers to help us get synchronised with our environment. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that differences between the groups must be caused either by intrinsic biological differences or by the difference in drug treatment."

"The pattern of motor activity in schizophrenic patients is marked by less complexity, a finding different from controls and patients with depression, and this finding may have both clinical and patho-physiological importance. The difference in motor activity complexity could reflect that motor activity derangements in schizophrenia and depression have different foundations."
