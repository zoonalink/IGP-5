## Notes

**Summary**

* Negative association between physical activity and depression well established but not the *precise characteristics* of physical activity patterns
* Complexity measures may identify unexplored aspects of activity patterns - e.g. extent to which there are reptitite periods of physical activity, diversity in durations, etc.
* Actigraphy data: 
  * 4 weeks (~40000 data points each individual)
  * n = 46 (25 non-depressed, 21 depressed)
* Results: 
  * Lower levels of complexity in actigraphy data from depressed group compared to non-depressed controls (in terms of lower mean duration of periods of recurrent physical activity and less diersity in duration of periods)
  * Diagnosis of depression was not significantly associated with mean activity levels or measures of circadian rhythm stability
